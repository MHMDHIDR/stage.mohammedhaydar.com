## Table of contents

## Picture Magic

Start simple by loading pictures. Think of it as the canvas for your visual masterpiece.

#### Layers of Wow

Layers make things fancy. It's like putting one picture on top of another for cool effects.

### Your Creative Playground

Time to make your own magic. Start with examples, tweak them, and save your work. Most importantly, enjoy the process!

### VJ: Beyond Visuals

#### Fun with Sound

Have you ever thought of making visuals dance to music? Imagine that! Play with tones and rhythms, it's like painting with sound.

#### No Limits

Explore and have fun. Use sensors, to make things interactive. It's your world; make it awesome!

### Visual Jockey: What's That?

#### Visual Jockey Fun

It's like being a DJ but with visuals – videos, images, all the cool stuff!

#### Free Tools!

Use free software. There are tutorials too, so no worries about where to start.

##### For example, I wish to create an interesting scene from this crystal:

1. This is my starting Image:
   <img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/nnrx9w3l/production/bbe0579e53ea4d55460235f7f25b9d834ea190d0-470x470.jpg" width="470" height="470" alt=" Discovering Visual Creativity" style="width: 400px" />

2. After dragging my handy tool (Picture Loader), I will be able to import my image to the canvas to apply visual Effects on it:
   <img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/nnrx9w3l/production/62e7632378b096d1eb829f7e5f76124e00d61b02-1904x968.png" width="470" height="470" alt=" Discovering Visual Creativity" style="width: 400px" />

3. I added Some Effects so I can make my image interesting, the effects are:

- 2D Effect Distortion
- 2D Effect Polar
- 3D Effect Sphere

This is what my Image looks like:
<img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/nnrx9w3l/production/5683b7e78c788720a00713f2369edd00984adca0-1405x818.png" width="470" height="470" alt=" Discovering Visual Creativity" style="width: 400px" />

4. After Rendering it as a video this is what it looks like:

<video width="550" height="340" style="width: 400px" controls>
  <source src="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/nnrx9w3l/production/394c05a422460347a22a79891fe2ffab2edc6e9e.webm" type="video/webm">

</video>

5. We can also use the power of Visual Jockey Software to use a sound and include it in my video from File -> Export Movie, and We need to check the write sound to track:

<img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/nnrx9w3l/production/0652484526f39c2b65f38289f2b1c90c73ff532f-1749x957.png" width="470" height="470" alt="Discovering Visual Creativity" style="width: 400px" />

6. Here is the Rendered out put video after including the sound:

<video width="550" height="340" style="width: 400px" controls>
  <source src="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/nnrx9w3l/production/22d51cd738183cf28d1e17b714f116481f04c69c.webm" type="video/webm">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

### Conclusion

#### Enjoy the Ride

VJ is about creating cool experiences. Start simple, and explore, remember, it's all about having fun and exploring your creativity!
