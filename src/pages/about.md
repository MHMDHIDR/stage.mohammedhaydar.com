## Features

Here are certain features about me.

💡 &nbsp; I'm a passionate web developer and a lifelong learner, juggling my time between freelance projects and being a dedicated student. I specialize in the MERN Stack, NextJS, and tRPC, crafting digital experiences that come to life.

🌍 &nbsp; Exploring the vibrant world of online eCommerce is my current adventure, conducting research to push the boundaries of what's possible in this space.

🎓 &nbsp; I'm currently a student at Middlesex University, London (Class of 2023-24), where I'm honing my skills and nurturing my curiosity.

🎓 &nbsp; I earned my stripes at Aptech Qatar Education Center back in 2017, where I first ignited my passion for technology and programming.

🔍 &nbsp; Beyond the code, I'm captivated by the realms of Computer Vision and the captivating yet somewhat mysterious world of Deepfake technologies.

🎥 &nbsp; When I'm not coding, you'll find me in the cinema, binging on series, or simply basking in the warmth of a beautiful sunset.
